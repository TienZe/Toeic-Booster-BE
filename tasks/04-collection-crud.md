# Task Overview
Create complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the Collection model, including database migration, model definition, repository, service, controller, and API endpoints.

# Task Status
`Done`

# Requirements
1. Create migration for the collection table with the following structure:
   - id (integer, primary key)
   - name (varchar)
   - description (varchar)
   - book_purchase_link (varchar)
   - thumbnail (varchar)
   - thumbnail_public_id (varchar)
2. Define Collection model
3. Create CollectionRepository
4. Create CollectionService
5. Create CollectionController
6. Create API endpoints for CRUD operations

# Scratchpad
Based on the project structure analysis, we'll follow these conventions:
- Models are placed in `src/app/Models/`
- Controllers are placed in `src/app/Http/Controllers/`
- Repositories are organized in directories under `src/app/Repositories/`
- Services are organized in directories under `src/app/Services/`
- API routes are defined in `src/routes/api.php`

## Step 1: Create Migration for Collection Table
- [X] Navigate to src/ directory
- [X] Generate migration file using Laravel artisan command: `php artisan make:migration create_collections_table`
- [X] Define the structure in the migration file with the required fields
- [X] Run the migration with `php artisan migrate`

## Step 2: Define Collection Model
- [X] Create Collection model using artisan command: `php artisan make:model Models/Collection`
- [X] Define fillable properties for mass assignment
- [X] Define any relationships if needed

## Step 3: Create Form Requests for Validation
- [X] Create StoreCollectionRequest: `php artisan make:request Collection/StoreCollectionRequest`
- [X] Create UpdateCollectionRequest: `php artisan make:request Collection/UpdateCollectionRequest`
- [X] Define validation rules for both requests

## Step 4: Create CollectionRepository
- [X] Create `Repositories/Collection` directory
- [X] Create CollectionRepository class with CRUD methods
- [X] Implement getAll, getById, create, update, and delete methods

## Step 5: Create CollectionService
- [X] Create `Services/Collection` directory
- [X] Create CollectionService class (manually created)
- [X] Implement business logic for CRUD operations
- [X] Inject CollectionRepository

## Step 6: Create CollectionController
- [X] Create CollectionController: `php artisan make:controller CollectionController --api`
- [X] Implement index, store, show, update, and destroy methods
- [X] Inject CollectionService

## Step 7: Define API Routes
- [X] Add API resource routes in `src/routes/api.php`
- [X] Test the endpoints with API client

# Task Lessons
1. Followed Laravel's conventions for organizing code in a structured manner with Models, Repositories, Services, Controllers, and Form Requests.
2. Created separate validation requests for store and update operations to maintain clean code.
3. Implemented a consistent JSON response format across all API endpoints.
4. Used type-hinting and return types to ensure code quality and maintainability.
5. Protected routes with JWT authentication middleware to ensure security.
6. Used best practices for RESTful API development with appropriate HTTP methods and status codes.
